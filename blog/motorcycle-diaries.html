            Well, all the plans we make get interrupted in one way or another for no reason. Sometimes it could be as silly as you falling ill or your boss horsing around.
            I had a very close friend who was working with me in my startup who was about to get married in Nashik. From the day of engagement, he kept inviting and I finally planned to go there. Indeed there were a few impediments from my company to not take leave blah-blah-blah. I had to thrash my boss, manager, co-workers to get the green flag. Anyway, I was compelled until the morning of the travel to not go. But you have this gut feeling, which keeps saying to "do you really want to sit here doing work or you want to go there and make a few memories which you can cherish for the rest of your life." Obviously, I took the action to go. Initially, I was planning to go by flight and come back in a couple of days. But I also had the vacation pending for that year. So I thought why not convert this into a vacation. I planned to make it a road trip and that with a bike. The distance was 1420kms from Chennai to Nashik. Almost everyone whom I asked if they accompany denied the request when hearing these two words "bike trip to Nashik" and "1420kms in road". Finally, I met a daredevil Kush - my college junior who was ready to do it.
            We kind of met for a couple of days in the previous week of travel and, made some arrangements and checklists. We finally fit all of our things in a rucksack which consisted of two pairs of trousers, a bandana, gloves, jacket, shoes, coolers, medicinal kit, little eatables, bike kits and spare parts, camera, etc. We started exactly on Wednesday of that week and planned to return before Monday morning. If calculated in that way, it would require to drive 560kms per day which was kind of doable with 2 members shifting and driving.

            Day 1 (19th Dec, 2019) Wednesday: I had to report in the morning to my boss for some work. I started from home by 11 o clock in the morning from my home to pick up my Kush. Once we packed all the stuff and were ready and started off to my office and had our lunch. I waved goodbye to a few friends and they were giving me their wishes and a few safety tips. When finally I was about to say bye to my boss, he was disappointed and was not ready to let me go. But still, I left knowing that everything is gonna be alright. We started somewhere around 2.30 pm from T.Nagar, Chennai. We even knocked off a starting picture of us and the bike. On one side, it was exciting and on the other side, it was scary enough that a single crash could put you to death or a single breakdown could ruin your trip, etc. But I went with my gut to face anything. These are the few decisions that you take in your face which helps makes life awesome. I thought let me take the complete drive here from Chennai to Bangalore on my own and let him take care the next day. Crossing the region of Sriperambudur was pretty hard. I was not able to go faster than 70(mph?) as the road was pretty much crowded with industrial vehicles. We pretty hit the downstream of Hosur by somewhere around 8 o clock. We planned to stay with one of my friend who was living there and spending the night there. We were completely knocked off. The sun was high which made it hard to ride and tiring. We had a good meal with my friend Pawan and boozed a little and had a good night's sleep. The day ended with 350kms completed and a bowl of good food.

            Day 2 (20th Dec 2019) Thursday: We started by early morning 6.30 am and hit the roads by giving a goodbye to Pawan. We didn't want to leave the place mostly our body didn't. Anyways after started we hit the road to reach Kohlapur(650kms from out point) by night so that we could reach the next day afternoon. We took a highway in Bangalore which lead us to Tumkur. The road was deserted. It was almost a 30kms stretch where you had no shops and petrol bunks. It is just a road which connects two points. So finally when I reached there, we stopped at a Udipi hotel to have our breakfast. The traditional plate Idli was awesome to have. With filled stomachs, I started to make a continuous stretch crossing Tumkur. We almost had a 4-hour drive with 10 mints break every 1 hour so that I can feel my tushie. Riding in that street bike for this long stretch was a tough one. Kush couldn't drive as he was feeling unwell. He started catching the flu. We stopped by 12 near a shop to have a cup of tea and refresh. I lubricated the chains when the tea was made. Surprisingly, I connected well with the locals and had a good chat with them. It also opened me the channels that what people of that background were going there. We got into action again by getting ready and reached Chitradurga (180kms). We went into the fort of Chitaldoorg and spent an hour. We were like outcasts hanging out in poorly rugged dresses, mud in face, and grease in the hand. Finally, the body was aching, we drove another 100kms and reached somewhere near Hubli and thought to have our food. We delayed food and had them late so we can cover more distance in the daylight. Around 4-5 in the evening, we stopped in a Rajasthani Dhaba to have our food. We had a few rotis and a cup of chaach. The food almost led us into sleep. We dozed off for an hour and waking up the time almost passed 7. We made another 150kms and called the day. We almost reached Belgaum which was before Kohlapur. We hired a low-cost motel and spent the night. Though the place was not comfortable, we didn't want to take the risk of losing time.

            Day 3 (21th Dec, 2019) Friday : We started early morning and reached the ghat section of Kohlapur. The temperature was almost 10deg and it was hard to ride. Kush was completely dozed off in the bike secret. He held the sidebars tightly and I continued the ride for another 3-4 hours nonstop till 10 am. We entered the state of Maharashtra and felt its time for breakfast. The traditional Vada pav and misal pav was readily available in every shop and we feasted ourselves with that. By the time of 11, we crossed Satara and started to end Pune. The entry of Pune from Karad would be like traveling in a connecting bridge between two hills. The view is astonishing to have a complete glance of the whole city. That is when I started to feel the fresh air of mountains after an hour from Satara. The Ghat roads mean something more than the normal ones. Once you drive that, you are stuck with the thought of it. We started again from Pune to Nashik with was through a variety of terrains like tunnels, mud roads, bridges, city roads, etc. It was a 200km road but it took me 4 hours to ride through. It ached as if every part of my body started to fall off. We anyhow got the local address and we were about to reach the street of Mohit's home. When we entered the street, there were a bunch of people standing outside a home and were getting ready for some ceremonies. I guessed this might be the home. When I got out of my bike with the big rucksack, helmet, gloves, muddy shoes, and dark faces people thought we were kind of some outcasts or nomads. Finally, Mohit found us out and called inside the home. We were tired as hell and wanted to hit the sheets. We were welcomed by his family members and we had a little homemade food which tasted like heaven. We directly went to Mohit’s room and had a few talks. We said we will take a little rest and then come back to the ceremony. I dozed off myself with a few shots of dark rum and hit the bed. I woke back by 9 o clock when the ceremony was almost over. Without thinking further I went directly to the place where food was provided and had started eating. People started murmuring pointing us. Then Mohit’s father and started to speak to us. Everybody was speaking about us how foolish is to travel from Chennai to Nashik by bike. I was not worried about that. If I had to, I would have never started from Chennai itself. We hit the bed after speaking with Mohit and his family members.

        Day 4 (22th Dec 2019) Saturday: The marriage ceremony started by 11 o clock and then ended by somewhere around 3 o clock. I started to clean and check my bike outside the lawn. When we about to leave almost some 10 members were gathered advising to be safe on the road. We reached the highways of Nashik by 4 o clock and all of a sudden I got a call from my boss saying he requires me on Monday morning. I knew if I wanted to, I could have said a no and taken a day's break. But I went with my gut feeling to reach Chennai in the next 36-40 hours. The climate started to worsen as the night grew. It was almost again 12-13deg when we started. We managed to cross Pune by 8 o clock and reach Satara by 10 o clock. We found a good motel on the highway and planned to rest for a few hours. We finished the day with a good plate of Chinese and driving 350kms from the evening.

            Day 5 (23th Dec 2019) Sunday: The last day arrived and I was ready to face it. We started by morning 8 o clock and we had 1050kms and 24 hours. I bought two packs of Marlboro to keep myself warm and running. I began the ride without having any other thought in my mind. I drove almost 4 hours at a stretch with 10 mins gaps and covered almost 300kms in that temperature. My mind was collapsing, I could not focus on the road and drive. Unnecessary thoughts would appear and distract my mind. All I did was focus on the road and kept saying that to my mind. I was tired as hell and thought of taking a break for some time. We stopped the bike on the highway and rested at the side. There was a big rock wall on which I laid down for an hour. I took off my shirt and felt the sunlight to make sure I don't sleep too much. The clock's ticked 4 o clock and we started again. We again made a continuous ride till Tumkur and reached by 7 o clock and had a delicious meal of the day. That's the first complete meal we had for that day. We started without delay as we knew were on track and would make it to Chennai if we go at the same pace.

            The next ride was a bit thrilling as we started to see a little highway filled with city lights when we were nearing Bangalore. And then we found our hope. Chennai was just 350kms ahead of us. Crossing Bangalore I was completely drained and was not able to open my eyes. I smoked every once when I was not able to open. The night dinners were a big plate of dosa and a few eggs. That allowed me to keep me awake for a while. We made another 120kms in a single stretch without any trouble. And it was almost 1 o clock in the night. We made random conversations in the petrol bunk to make us enthusiastic. We stopped the bike and heard a few songs and even dance a little. Nothing worked as we were completely drained. But one cigarette at a time helped me to drive for another 15-20 mints. All I did was challenge myself that I could have a puff if I drive another 30kms. I completed almost a complete pack doing that. but almost reached Chennai by morning 4 o clock. I almost had tears in my eyes when I reached near the place.

            There were a few thoughts that hit me rock bottom at that time.
1. You can do more than what your mind interprets. All you need to do is to push yourself a little.
            2. A single mistake can cost you a fortune and you shouldn't take life that easily too.
3. Passion is what should really matter. not your salary, your boss's appreciation, your friends, your family, none of them.
4. You have nothing to lose, you have to risk your stake to see things.

I was able to achieve almost 1000kms in 20 hours. I had doubts in myself when beginning, but the thrill realized I can if I had the passion to do it. And finally, I did it.
